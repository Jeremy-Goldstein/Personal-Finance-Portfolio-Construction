# Personal Finance: Portfolio Construction with Factor Tilts

## Motivation

In the past, investors had few options as well as mechanisms for purchasing fixed income and equities in their portfolio. However, with the proliferation of low-cost retail brokerages, the "ETF revolution", and data-driven financial research being implemented in live products, today investors have several strategies and thousands of funds available. Still, especially for those beginning to invest, it can be incredibly difficult to understand all the options available, let alone choose the best fit for their level of financial literacy and specific situation. 

In order of increasing complexity, the: one-decision asset allocation i.e. "Target Date" funds, robo-advisors, broad market indexes, and direct indexing. With increasing complexity, comes greater personalization, tax efficiency, and fee management - ultimately leading to higher returns. Since direct indexing is only accessible for those with millions under management, the goal of this project, then, is to help manage the increasing complexity for those who choose broad-market indexes using a dynamically-updating, accessible Google Sheet. 

## Spreadsheet Usage

All cells that dynamically adjust to user input are locked, meaning a warning will appear if they are changed. In other words, the spreadsheet is set up so that you only have to input information unique to your situation, outlined below. Be aware that functionality may be disrupted should you choose to modify other cells, but doing so is encouraged: All formulas use Named Ranges (referring to cells by variable-like names instead of by cell column/number) to make modifications easier.  

* Access the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Sl32vNc95Agf1k2oQp6iBLzTQxWHLeMlYLO7PUxcIds/edit?usp=sharing) and make a copy saved to your Google Drive to enable editing
* Replace the example values in the grey cells from rows 20-22:
  * Portfolio Goal
  * Factor Tilt
  * Behavior Tilt
  * Risk Tolerance
* Replace any example Ticker with another ETF, mutual fund, or stock, and the other columns will automatically update
* Switch to the second sheet "Portfolio: Balance" and input the units owned of each security
* Visit portfoliovisualizer.com using the Direct Analysis links to get detailed information about your current portfolio; note that any change to Tickers or Target Portfolio will automatically be reflected in these links
* Toggle the checkboxes to view the balances in different accounts, using the Error in Balance column to understand how to rebalance
